          <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Personas:</h2>
          <p class="text-white-50">João André, professor, 35 years old. Believes that a system capable to analyse the mental state of his students can be really benefic to his job. Expects to be able to monitor
            concentration levels of the students and make the necessary changes to his lectures, making sure to get maximum leves of attention from everyone in the longest period of time.

          <p class="text-white mb-50">Ricardo Rodrigues, business man, 42 years old. Believes that the capacity to analyse the mood and mental fatigue of his employees is fundamental to the well being of his company, being able to change 
            work loads and shifts, boosting productivity.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white mb-50">Alberto Nogueira, doctor, 56 years old. Has interest in the system to be able to study and compare productivity between a healthy and an ill person. 
            This, with a large number of users performing the testing may be helpful to see if some desease is limiting productivity of anyone that suffers from it.

          <p class="text-white mb-50">Bruno Gaspar, student, 20 years olf. Would like to analyse his capacity of keeping high levels of concentration during long study periods, allowing him to choose 
            when he can get the best results, providing a tool to organize himself better, and removing some time that he couldn't reach the necessary levels of attention to study.</p>
          <p class="text-white mb-50">Luís Pires, programmer, 30 years old. Assures the maintenence of the system, will have constant access to it to detect any possible bug, and will be slowly upgrading and updating the system.</p>
        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Scenarios:</h2>
        <p class="text-white mb-50">It is expected that a teacher can use the system and obtain information in real time regarding attention levels of every student.</p>
        <p class="text-white mb-50">It is expected that an employer can monitor the produtivity levels of every employee.</p>
        <p class="text-white mb-50">It is expected that a doctor can study the capacity oh the pacients, given some already known vulnerabilities.</p>
